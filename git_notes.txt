You can create different Git branches, and change which is active. Im assuming that in this way you can work on projects while leaving the "master" branch alone. 

git branch branchname = creates a new branch
git branch = view the available branches
git checkout branchname = change active branch

Hey guys, workin on pushing to git hub.

When you push to git hub it only pushes the branch you've told it to

command is .... $ git push -u origin master

the -u is only for the first push and basically allows you to shortcus the pushes to master, or whatever you assigned it to.
